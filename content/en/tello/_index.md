Your Bell AVR Competition NEW team registration includes complimentary access to the full DroneBlocks curriculum suite for one year. The REC Foundation will email you the link to your complimentary license.  Teams that have competed in previous seasons that would like to renew their license can do so directly on the DroneBlocks website using a credit card [here](https://usg02.safelinks.protection.office365.us/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fsso.teachable.com%2Fsecure%2F94245%2Fcheckout%2F2366700%2Fmembership&data=05%7C01%7Cnbrownback%40bellflight.com%7Cf71497e5775d40f21bf408dba4211a16%7Cb347614d8a514dfe8bf716d51e6f6db8%7C0%7C0%7C638284234290307080%7CUnknown%7CTWFpbGZsb3d8eyJWIjoiMC4wLjAwMDAiLCJQIjoiV2luMzIiLCJBTiI6Ik1haWwiLCJXVCI6Mn0%3D%7C3000%7C%7C%7C&sdata=95tYpVD3n9GFHH2aGldrSkqIhLxIqaMNBR14t%2BP4UPc%3D&reserved=0) or send a purchase order to support@droneblocks.io.

Included with this curriculum is a series of videos that will help you learn
troubleshooting techniques, safety procedures, and other tips that will prove to be
valuable during class time. It's highly encouraged that you review all of these videos prior to operating the Tello:

Note that your Tello has been shipped with the firmware already updated to the latest
version. So, you can skip that step any time it is mentioned, and jump straight into
programming with the DroneBlocks app!
